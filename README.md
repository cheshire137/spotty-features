# Spotty Features

I want to play around with Spotify's
[audio features API endpoints](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-several-audio-features/).

## How to Develop

You will need [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed in macOS.

```bash
brew update
brew install yarn
yarn install
node src/server.js
```
